# Simple Todo App

We've created a simple todo app that alowes you to create a list of todo items you can interact with.

## Functionality

The application allows you to create a new item to go into your todo list and allows you to delete any items that are already added to the list. It also allows you to mark a todo as completed by clicking the checkbox assigned to your list item to keep track with your todo list. The process of adding the item is by clicking the "Add Todo" button and prompts you to input the name for your todo as well as an option for a due date. Once you click create, the program will log your new todo item into the list for you to interact with.
